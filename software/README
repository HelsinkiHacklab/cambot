The high-level control (and video streaming) is handled by 3 services on a laptop

  * streamserver
    This will handle the camera streams, overlays etc
  * controlserver
    This will talk with the Arduino
  * tcpserver
    This will handle incoming TCP control protocol connections
    and talk with controlserver and streamserver accordingly

All of these will use DBUS for IPC.

There will also be a few client programs that talk with the tcpserver but more about them later
