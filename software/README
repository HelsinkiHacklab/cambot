The high-level control (and video streaming) is handled by 3 services on a laptop

  * streamserver
    This will handle the camera streams, overlays etc
  * controlserver
    This will talk with the Arduino
  * tcpserver
    This will handle incoming TCP control protocol connections
    and talk with controlserver and streamserver accordingly

All of these will use DBUS for IPC.

There will also be a few client programs that talk with the tcpserver but more about them later.

Software will be written in Python first, if there are performance bottlenecks (streamserver overlays are just about the only place I can think of) then those parts will be rewritten in Vala.
